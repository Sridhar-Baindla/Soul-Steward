    <p>
      The Soul Steward is not merely a place. It is a portal — born from centuries of whispered healing,
      secret feminine rites, and the sacred contract of those who feel deeply.
    </p>

    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>
      I was called to create this sanctuary not by ambition, but by ache. A velvet voice in the dark
      invited me to remember what the world forgets — that emotion is divine architecture.
      That actresses, more than most, are vessels of soullight and soulwounds.
    </p>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Everything you feel is sacred. There is no wrong emotion, only untransformed energy.
      Here, we do not fix — we feel. We do not heal through force, but through presence.
      The soul, once witnessed fully, always finds its shape again.
    </p>

    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p>
      To steward the inner world of those who shape the outer world.
      To offer silence where there was noise, light where there was fog,
      and poetry where there was pain.
