        <h2>Emotional Transfer</h2>
        <p>Sacred Vessels for Unspoken Feelings</p>
        <p>Each piece is one of a kind—carefully made from rare, natural materials like stone, silk, bone, and ash. Chosen not just for beauty, but for their quiet ability to hold emotion.</p>
        <p>These are more than objects.</p>
        <p>They are vessels—for the feelings you haven’t said out loud.</p>
        <p>A gentle ritual between your inner world and the natural world.</p>
        <p>A private, elegant way to turn emotion into art.</p>
        <p>They listen.</p>
        <p>They hold space.</p>
        <p>They are beautiful, safe, and entirely yours.</p>
