        <h2>Presence Sessions</h2>
        <p>An Invitation to Stillness, Grace, and True Connection</p>
        <p>Step into a quiet space where nothing is expected and everything is allowed. Here, silence is a gift—and simply being is more than enough.</p>
        <p>No talking. No pressure. No roles to play.</p>
        <p>Just the gentle experience of sharing space in calm—like soft light through curtains or the comfort of a warm breeze at dusk.</p>
        <p>This is your sanctuary. A place to rest your heart, release the noise, and return to yourself. You are seen, supported, and softly held—in stillness that heals.</p>
        <p>Because peace doesn’t come from doing more—</p>
        <p>It comes from letting yourself simply be.</p>
